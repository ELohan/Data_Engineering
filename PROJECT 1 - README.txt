# Fake Mortgage Loans Dataset Generator

This project generates a synthetic dataset of fake mortgage loans using Python and the Faker library. Below are instructions on how to set up and run the project.

This README file provides users with clear instructions on how to install Python, install the required packages, run the project, and customize it as needed. 

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have Python and the required packages installed on your system.

### Installing Python

If you don't have Python installed, follow these steps to get it:

1. Visit the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

To verify that Python is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```shell
python --version

You should see the Python version displayed.

Installing Required Packages
After installing Python, you need to install the necessary packages. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

pip install pandas
pip install faker

These commands will install the pandas library for data manipulation and the Faker library for generating fake data.

Running the Project
To generate the fake mortgage loans dataset, follow these steps:

Clone or download this project to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt.

Run the Python script generate_fake_loans.py:
python generate_fake_loans.py

The script will generate the dataset and save it as a CSV file named fake_mortgage_loans.csv in the same directory.

Customization
You can customize the number of fake loans and other parameters in the generate_fake_loans.py script to suit your needs. Feel free to modify the code as required.
