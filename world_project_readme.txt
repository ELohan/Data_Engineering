SQL Project - World Database Analysis
Overview:
This project showcases various SQL queries and database analysis using the "World" database, covering a range of topics including data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, joins, and subqueries. 
The project is designed to help users understand SQL concepts and explore the data within the "World" database.

Prerequisites
Before you can run this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

MySQL Workbench: The project was developed using MySQL Workbench, so you'll need this tool to execute the SQL queries.
Installation
Follow these steps to install MySQL Workbench:

Download MySQL Workbench:

Visit the MySQL Workbench download page.
Select your operating system and download the appropriate version.
Install MySQL Workbench:

Run the installer you downloaded in the previous step.
Follow the installation wizard's prompts to complete the installation.
Configure MySQL Server Connection (if necessary):

During installation, you may be prompted to configure a MySQL server connection.
Provide the necessary details (such as hostname, port, username, and password) to connect to your MySQL server. If you don't have a MySQL server set up, consider using XAMPP or MySQL Community Server to set up a local MySQL server.
Usage
Clone the Repository:

Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-sql-project.git
Open MySQL Workbench:

Launch MySQL Workbench on your computer.
Load the SQL Files: "World" & "File1"

Open the SQL files containing the queries from your cloned project directory in MySQL Workbench. You can typically do this by clicking on "File" > "Open SQL Script."
Execute the Queries: "World" followed by "File1"

Highlight the SQL queries you want to execute in the SQL file.
Click the "Execute" button (or press Ctrl + Enter or Cmd + Enter).
View Query Results:

The query results will be displayed in the lower panel of MySQL Workbench, where you can see the output of each query.
Explore and Analyze Data:

Explore the SQL queries to retrieve various insights from the "World" database. Feel free to modify the queries or create new ones to further analyze the data.
Sample Queries
In the project, you will find sample SQL queries that demonstrate different aspects of SQL, including joins, subqueries, aggregations, and more. These queries are a great starting point for your exploration.
